# 100 Days of Swift

100 Days Challenge to learn the [Swift](https://swift.org/) language. 

#
### Day 1: First Steps in Swift

- Variables
- Strings and Integers
- Multiline Strings
- Doubles and Booleans
- String Interpolation
- Constants
- Type Annotations

### Day 2: Complex Data Types

- Arrays, sets, tuples, and dictionaries let you store a group of items under a single value. They each do this in different ways, so which you use depends on the behavior you want.
- Arrays store items in the order you add them, and you access them using numerical positions.
- Sets store items without any order, so you can’t access them using numerical positions.
- Tuples are fixed in size, and you can attach names to each of their items. You can read items using numerical positions or using your names.
- Dictionaries store items according to a key, and you can read items using those keys.
- Enums are a way of grouping related values so you can use them without spelling mistakes.
- You can attach raw values to enums so they can be created from integers or strings, or you can add associated values to store additional information about each case.

### Day 3: Operators and Conditions

- Swift has operators for doing arithmetic and for comparison; they mostly work like you already know.
- There are compound variants of arithmetic operators that modify their variables in place: +=, -=, and so on.
- You can use if, else, and else if to run code based on the result of a condition.
- Swift has a ternary operator that combines a check with true and false code blocks. Although you might see it in other code, I wouldn’t recommend using it yourself.
- If you have multiple conditions using the same value, it’s often clearer to use switch instead.
- You can make ranges using ..< and ... depending on whether the last number should be excluded or included.
